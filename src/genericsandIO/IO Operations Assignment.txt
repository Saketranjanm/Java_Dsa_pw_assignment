Q1.What is input and output stream in java?

In Java, input and output streams are the primary means of performing input and output operations, respectively.
They provide a uniform and consistent way to read from and write to various sources and destinations, such as files, network connections, and in-memory buffers.
Input Stream:
An input stream is a sequence of data bytes that can be read from a data source.
Input streams are used to read data from various sources, such as files, network sockets, and standard input (e.g., keyboard).
The InputStream class is the abstract superclass for all input stream classes in Java. It provides methods for reading bytes of data from the input source.

Output Stream:
An output stream is a sequence of data bytes that can be written to a data destination.
Output streams are used to write data to various destinations, such as files, network sockets, and standard output (e.g., console).
The OutputStream class is the abstract superclass for all output stream classes in Java. It provides methods for writing bytes of data to the output destination.

Q2.What are the methods of outputstream?

In Java, the OutputStream class is an abstract class representing an output stream of bytes. It serves as the superclass for all classes representing output streams.
some of the common methods defined in the OutputStream class and commonly used in its subclasses:
write(int b): Writes the specified byte to the output stream. The byte is represented by the lowest eight bits of the integer argument.
write(byte[] b): Writes an array of bytes to the output stream. Writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to the output stream.
write(byte[] b, int off, int len): Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the output stream.
flush(): Flushes the output stream, forcing any buffered output bytes to be written out.
close(): Closes the output stream and releases any system resources associated with it. Once closed, further write operations may result in an IOException.

Q3.What is serialization in java?


Serialization in Java refers to the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes, which can be easily stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved in a database.
The reverse process of converting a stream of bytes back into an object is called deserialization.
Serialization is primarily used for data persistence and communication between Java applications running on different platforms.

Q4.What is the serializable interface in java?

The Serializable interface in Java is a marker interface that indicates that a class's instances can be serialized.
It doesn't contain any methods or fields; its sole purpose is to provide metadata to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that objects of the class can be converted into a stream of bytes and vice versa.
When a class implements the Serializable interface, it signals to the JVM that its instances can be serialized using Java's built-in serialization mechanism.
This mechanism converts an object's state (its instance variables) into a stream of bytes, which can then be stored in a file, transmitted over a network, or saved in a database.
The reverse process, deserialization, reconstructs an object from the stream of bytes.

Q5.What is deserialization in java?

Deserialization in Java refers to the process of reconstructing an object from its serialized form, which is a stream of bytes. 
When an object is serialized, its state (its instance variables) is converted into a series of bytes that can be easily stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved in a database.
Deserialization reverses this process, converting the stream of bytes back into an object with the same state as the original object.

Q6.How is serialization achieved in java?

erialization in Java is achieved using the built-in serialization mechanism provided by the Java platform. 
This mechanism allows objects to be converted into a stream of bytes, which can then be easily stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved in a database. 
The reverse process, deserialization, converts the stream of bytes back into an object.

import java.io.*;
public class SerializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass(1, "John");
        try {
            ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("object.ser"));
            out.writeObject(obj);
            out.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Q7.How is deserialization achieved in java?

Deserialization in Java is achieved by converting a stream of bytes back into an object's state, reconstructing the object from its serialized form. 
It is the reverse process of serialization, where an object is converted into bytes. 
Java provides built-in classes and methods to perform deserialization efficiently.

import java.io.*;
public class DeserializationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("object.ser"));
            MyClass obj = (MyClass) in.readObject();
            in.close();
            System.out.println("Deserialized Object: " + obj.getId() + ", " + obj.getName());
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

Q8.How can you avoid certain member variables of class from getting serialized?


in Java, you can prevent certain member variables of a class from being serialized by marking them as transient. 
When a member variable is marked as transient, it tells the Java serialization mechanism to exclude that variable from the serialization process.

import java.io.Serializable;
public class MyClass implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private int id;
    private transient String transientData;
}
In this example, the transientData member variable is marked as transient. 
When instances of MyClass are serialized, the transientData variable will not be included in the serialized form of the object.

Q9.What classes are available in the java IO File classes API?


The Java I/O (Input/Output) package provides a variety of classes and interfaces to perform input and output operations in Java. 
Within the I/O package, the java.io.File class and its related classes are commonly used for file and directory operations.

File:
java.io.File: Represents a file or directory pathname. It provides methods for creating, deleting, renaming, and querying files and directories.

Input/Output Streams:
java.io.FileInputStream: Reads bytes from a file.
java.io.FileOutputStream: Writes bytes to a file.
java.io.FileReader: Reads characters from a file.
java.io.FileWriter: Writes characters to a file.

Buffered Streams:
java.io.BufferedReader: Reads text from a character-input stream with efficiency (buffered).
java.io.BufferedWriter: Writes text to a character-output stream with efficiency (buffered).

Character Streams:
java.io.InputStreamReader: Reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset.
java.io.OutputStreamWriter: Writes characters to an output stream, converting them into bytes using a specified charset.

Other File-related Classes:
java.io.FileDescriptor: Represents the file descriptor for the standard input, output, and error streams.
java.io.FilePermission: Represents the permission for a file or directory.
java.io.FileFilter: Interface for filtering files based on various criteria.
java.io.FilenameFilter: Interface for filtering filenames based on various criteria.

Q10.What is Differences between Externalizable and Serialization interface.

Serializable:
Serializable is a marker interface i.e. does not contain any method.
Serializable interface passes the responsibility of serialization to JVM and its default algorithm.
Mostly, default serialization is easy to implement, but has a higher performance cost.
It’s hard to analyze and modify class structure because any change may break the serialization.
Default serialization does not call any class constructor.

Externalizable:
Externalizable interface includes two methods writeExternal() and readExternal() which implementing classes MUST override.
Externalizable provides control of serialization logic to the programmer – to write custom logic.
Serialization done using Externalizable, add more responsibility to the programmer but often results in better performance.
It’s easier to analyze and modify class structure because of complete control over serialization logic.
A public no-arg constructor is required while using Externalizable interface.
